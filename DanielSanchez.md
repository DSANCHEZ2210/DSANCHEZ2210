- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Daniel Sanchez
I am a passionate student from Mexico, currently in my third semester at TecnolÃ³gico de Monterrey, Campus Guadalajara. I have a deep love for programming and mathematics, and I enjoy using both to solve complex problems and create efficient solutions.
I am always eager to learn more and take on new challenges. I believe that my passion for programming and mathematics, combined with my determination, will help me continue to grow as a developer and make meaningful contributions to every project I work on.
